# Dynamic Asset Allocation and Diversification Techniques


Python files are divided into:

- `data_and_descriptives.py` for descriptives, download information, and visualization of the selected assets.
- `dynamic_asset_allocation.py` for Dynamic Asset Allocation using CPPI, MDD, RDD, and EDD.
- `diversification.py` for diversification of the portfolio using rebalancing strategies and variants of EW rebalancing with stop loss and take profit.

Jupyter Notebook files contain examples of how to use it.

The file `etf_ib_data.xlsx` contains descriptives about ETFs.
